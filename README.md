# SortingandSearching_Application
A sorting and searching application developed in Java Swing. Here I only try to get all the sorting and searching algorithms working in GUI Form

Here I only try to get all the sorting and searching algorithms working in GUI Form. The sorting algorithm used here are the bubble, selection, and insertion sort, and linear and binary search are used for searching. These are very basic data structure algorithms where I only try to get a GUI Experience of these algorithms.
Note: As this a very basic application these may contain a lot of errors and will try to update it as per your suggestion and with more features in further updates.
